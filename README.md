# üöÄ Data Analysis Foundation Journey

Welcome to my repository documenting my journey through the **Data Analysis Foundation Journey**, a hands-on technical training program designed to build real-world coding and problem-solving skills. This repository contains my daily notes, practice exercises, and project files developed during the immersive **10-day program**.

## üìú About the Program

The **Data Analysis Foundation Journey** is focused on bridging the gap between academic knowledge and industry-relevant technical skills. Throughout the program, I‚Äôve worked on practical exercises covering topics such as:

* Linux & Shell Scripting
* Core and Advanced Python
* SQL(Structured Querying Language)
* Working with Relational Databases using Python

## üìÇ Repository Structure

* **Domain-wise Notes**: Summaries, commands, examples, and key takeaways from each session.
* **Python Projects**: A collection of mini-projects and exercises to strengthen Python skills.
* **SQL Testcase and Usecases**: Operational usecases and testcases based on pure SQL.

## üõ†Ô∏è Topics Covered

### Day 1 Overview

* Set up Python environment and install required libraries .
* Wrote basic python codes, Understood python and took it to minor python projects.
* Check the `Day-1` folder for all codes and annotated note along with projects.

### From Day 2 Onward

* Dived into Python fundamentals and advanced topics.
* Performed CRUD operations with SQLite/MySQL using Python.
* Developed CLI-based mini applications.
