# üöÄ Data Analysis Foundation Journey

Welcome to my repository documenting my journey through the **TechLearning Bootcamp**, a hands-on technical training program designed to build real-world coding and problem-solving skills. This repository contains my daily notes, practice exercises, and project files developed during the immersive **15-day program**.

## üìú About the Program

The **TechLearning Bootcamp** is focused on bridging the gap between academic knowledge and industry-relevant technical skills. Throughout the program, I‚Äôve worked on practical exercises covering topics such as:

* Linux & Shell Scripting
* Core and Advanced Python
* Working with Relational Databases using Python

## üìÇ Repository Structure

* **Day-wise Notes**: Daily summaries, commands, examples, and key takeaways from each session.
* **Shell Scripts**: Useful scripts written during Linux shell scripting modules.
* **Python Projects**: A collection of mini-projects and exercises to strengthen Python skills.
* **Assessments**: Code challenges, test snippets, and solutions from baseline and mid-program evaluations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Topics Covered

### Day 1 Overview

* Set up Linux (Ubuntu) via VirtualBox.
* Explored basic commands: `pwd`, `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `touch`, etc.
* Wrote first shell scripts to automate simple tasks like arithmetic operations.
* Check the `Day-1` folder for all scripts and annotated notes.

### From Day 2 Onward

* Dived into Python fundamentals and advanced topics.
* Performed CRUD operations with SQLite/MySQL using Python.
* Developed CLI-based mini applications (updates will continue as I progress).

## üìñ How to Use This Repository

To get started:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/TechLearning-Bootcamp-Journey.git
```

Browse through the day-wise folders for notes and source code. You‚Äôre welcome to reuse the material to support your own learning.

## ü§ù Contributions & Collaboration

This repository is part of my personal learning experience, but I‚Äôm open to feedback and collaborations! If you find something interesting or worth improving, feel free to fork the repo and submit a pull request.
